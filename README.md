# Git and Github

 ---
### Key Points

1. #### Repository: 
A project directory that Git manages. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a platform like GitHub).
2. #### Commit: 
A snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID.
3. #### Branch: 
A separate line of development. The main branch is usually the main codebase, but you can create new branches for features or experiments.
4. #### Clone: 
Copying a remote repository to your local machine.
5. #### 
Push: Uploading your local changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
6. #### Pull: 
Downloading the latest changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
7. #### Merge: 
Combining the changes from different branches.
